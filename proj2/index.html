    		<h1>Project 2</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I implemented how to interpolate control points for Bezier curves and various components that led to implementing loop subdivision for triangle meshes. I learned that complex operations can be boiled down to simple yet general cases and diagrams that are closely considered individually. Also, implementation details and the order of API calls can be important when managing pointers and stored values in complex operations like loop subdivision. Lastly, even though these algorithms are breakthrough ideas, they do have their quirks, like the loss of edges and boundary conditions in loop subdivision and how hard it is to make spirals with de Casteliau subdivision. We need to closely consider the algorithms we use for our purposes and know their pros and cons.

            <h2>Section 1: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

            <h3>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>
            <p>
                de Casteljau's algorithm uses (n+1) control points and a variable t in [0, 1] to create a curve that is to the user's specifications. To draw the curve in 2D, we first fix t to some value, then take the lerp between adjacent control points using t. Recursively take the lerp of adjacent points until you have one left. The last point lies on the Bezier curve. Then, we do this procedure for many samples of t to generate a nice looking curve.
            </p>

            <p>For example, here is a 6-control point Bezier curve that I made. The green is the fully evaluated Belzier curve and the white connect the original control points:</p>

            </div>

            <p>The following pictures show the steps of evaluation for de Casteljau's algorithm at a certain t (approx t=0.5). As expected, there are 6-1=5 steps to get the final point per t. The blue is the evaluation at a time step</p>

            <p>If you shift t, the final point is on a different part of the resulting curve:</p>

            <p>If you shift the control points, the curve changes, as well</p>

            <h3>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

            <p>
                The main difference between specifying curves and surfaces is that surfaces are in 3D so we need a grid of points instead of a line of them. de Casteljau extends to Bezier surfaces if we say that the rows of our specification (a matrix, now) are Bezier curves that we calculated in the 2D case and we want to interpolate across them with de Casteljau after we found the final points on them. So, for a spot (u, v) on the Bezier surface, the u would specify the "vertical" axis and the v would specify the "horizontal" axis. Essentially, we run de Casteljau once per row then one more time to combine the rows.

            <h3>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

            <p>
                I implemented area-weighted normals by first making code infrastructure to travel from the vertex of interest, go around an adjacent triangle (while saving the vertices of the triangle), then to to the next face adjacent to this vertex through the twin of the last edge. There is a simple trigonometric formula for the area of a triangle based on the positions of the vertices. And a vector normal to this triangle is the cross product of 2 vectors connecting vertices of this triangle. Thus, the area-weighted normal is the normalized sum of normal vector * area across all adjacent triangles.

            <h3>Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>

            <p>
                I implemented edge flip by first drawing labeled diagrams for the before and after of a general edge flip operation. The diagram below can be used WLOG because it can be rotated and skewed to generalize.
            </p>

            <div align="center">
                <p><u>Labeled diagram for edge flipping</u></p>
                <img src="imgs/1_4/prep.png" width="200px">
            </div>

            <p>
                I then saved all the relevant halfedges, edges, faces, and vertices as local variables with the appropriate name. The next step was to assign all attributes of these variables to their new values, as designated in the second diagram. I had to be very careful.
            </p>

            <div align="center">
                <p><u>Before flips</u></p>
                <img src="imgs/1_4/1.png" width="500px">
            </div>
            <div align="center">
                <p><u>After flips</u></p>
                <img src="imgs/1_4/2.png" width="500px">
            </div>

            <p>
                My debugging journey was quite extensive and memorable. At first, I didn't have the -- connecting e0 on the second diagram, so after all the work of assigning attributes, I actually reconnected the vertices the exact way they came! There were also times when I mixed up h0's top/left halfedge with its bottom/right halfedge. Fun stuff
            </p>

            <h3>Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

            <p>
                I implemented the edge split operation very similarly to the edge flip operation. I first drew out the before and after layout of a simple yet configuration.
            </p>

            <div align="center">
                <p><u>Labeled diagram for edge splitting</u></p>
                <img src="imgs/1_5/prep.png" width="200px">
            </div>

            <p>
                Then, I copied all the existing edges, vertices, halfedges, and faces to local variables. In this task, I added a section of code to create the new edges, halfedges, and vertex m (m is the midpoint of 2 existing vertices in position) with empty initializations. Then I assigned all the attributes according to my diagram. Since it is very hard to experimentaly debug this function due to its large number of parts, I decided to first debug through theory and concepts--checking and double checking my work as I wrote each section of code.
            </p>

            <div align="center">

                <img src="imgs/1_5/3.png" width="500px">
            </div>

            <p>
                Surprisingly, I did not have much of a debugging journey when implementing this task. The only problem was that I forgot to assign the position of the midpoint m, but I found that by noticing that the split operation made the correct x-shaped faces, but only had a vertex sticking deep into the teapot. Other than that, implementation was pretty smooth, probably since I invested time into debugging through concepts.
            </p>

            <h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

            <p>
                I implemented loop subdivision by first calculating the new positions for the original verticies (and saving them in an attribute of the vertex) and new positions for the new vertices after splits (and saving them in the edges that will be split). These calcuations used the weightings based on neighbors, as defined in the design doc. Then, I split every edge that had not been split yet; all new edges are marked as isNew=true in the split function. I had to also track isVeryNew in the split fuction, which is a new attribute that I added that is true if the edge was newly drawn and false if it is one of the two edges that lie on the original edge (that was split). Then, I flip every isVeryNew=true edge in the mesh that connects a new and old vertex. After that, old vertices are assigned positions that were stored in their attributes, and new vertices are assigned positions that were stored in any adjacent edge, pointed to by their halfedge. One major change to the flip and split functions were that I only reassigned a vertex's halfedge if it was originally pointing to a flipped or split edge; I was careful to not touch more than I needed to because that tended to lose track of the newPosition information in adjacent edges.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some highlights of example meshes and how they behave under my loop subdivision implementation</p>

            <p>One thing about the original dae/cube.dae mesh is that it loses its sharp edges throughout loop subdivision and actually turns very spherical. After experimenting with flips and splits, I realized that making the mesh structure more complex on each face tends to preserve the flatness and sharpness of faces and edges.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Also, I noticed that dae/cude.dae is lopsided after repeated subdivisions, based on the original asymmetry of the triangles in the mesh. One fix was to split all the face edges to make the original triangles symmetric about the middle of the cube. Now it subdivides symmetrically</p>
